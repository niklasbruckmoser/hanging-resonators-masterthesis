Project for generating GDS files (wafers and chips) with the klayout python module.

A (kind of) detailed tutorial is the src/Scripting.py file, which contains all steps for creating own samples

Important files/folders:

src/ChipBuilder.py
- main file, a ChipBuilder object with given parameters can create and save chips in a given frequency range as .gds files
- main usage (for details see source code): cb = ChipBuilder(optional params); cb.create_chip("save_name", resonator_params)
- Example code in src/Scripting

src/library/CPWLibrary/CellParams.py
- helper file containing all the parametric cell params

src/WaferBuilder.py
- can be used to fill up a 4 inch (or every possible size) wafer with structures generated by the Blueprint class
- main usage: wb = WaferBuilder(optional params); wb.create_wafer("wafer-name", chip_list)
- Example code in src/Scripting

src/library
- helper library for generating all the PCells used by klayout

src/coplanar_coupler.py (external, modified)
- helper file for calculating the coupling between the transmission line and the resonator. Needed for calculating Q_ext

Additional files/folders:

templates:
- folder containing external gds files, e.g. the logos and markers

kappaValues.txt:
- binary file containing the coupling constants for given parameters.

Project for generating GDS files (wafers and chips) with the klayout python module.

Important files/folders:

src/Blueprint.py
- main file, a Blueprint object with given parameters can create and save chips in a given frequency range as .gds files
- main usage (for details see source code): bp = Blueprint(optional params); bp.create_chip("save_name", start_frequency, end_frequency)
- Example code in src/Scripting

src/Params.py
- helper file containing all the chip params for the Blueprint class to make code more structured

src/WaferBuilder.py
- can be used to fill up a 4 inch (or every possible size) wafer with structures generated by the Blueprint class
- main usage: wb = WaferBuilder(optional params); wb.create_wafer_from_folder("wafer-name", "folder", amount_per_resonator)
- Example code in src/scripting

src/coplanar_coupler.py (external, modified)
- helper file for calculating the coupling between the transmission line and the resonator. Needed for calculating Q_ext

src/library (external, modified)
- helper library for generating all the PCells used by klayout

Additional files/folders:

templates:
- folder containing external gds files, e.g. the logos and markers

kappaValues.txt:
- binary file containing the coupling constants for given parameters.
